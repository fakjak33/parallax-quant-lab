"""Carry proxy for ETFs.

True carry needs a term structure / yield. For equity & commodity ETFs we
approximate the carry premium with a long-horizon risk-adjusted drift (the
asset's own tendency to earn a positive return per unit risk), smoothed.
This is a deliberately simple stand-in so the 'carry' style is represented;
swap in real yield/roll data later for futures.
